# Generative-Art-Repo
my goal is redefine how viewers see art, the plan is to deploy art that says deeper things than meets the eye

This collection of generative art is what I would call the “LIFE COLLECTION”
In my eyes, they have a narrative of Different Life Experiences or tell stories of the life cycles, Ideal and realistic, of different races, Social Class and across all ages.
In actual terms, there’s no segregation because every human life on earth encounters these phases even those who seem to have it all figured out, 
whether born with a silver spoon or raised in the Slums.
 
GENERATIVE LIFE ART EXPLAINED
Shape
Majority of the entry come in seemingly circular patterns, and some in horizontal patterns – those choices of shapes aren’t without purpose.
Life can be likened to an endless cycle. Some have argued that life never ends, personally I believe in life
after life, so it was an easy choice to make, but my believe didn’t limit my generation of this collection of art.
The horizontal patterned art is life likened to an ocean, a sea or a river at least. They come in different
length and depth, but they all have an end at some point.

Colors
The colors in the art capture two genres of Belonging; Race and Social Status/Class
Black&White version of the art signifying neutrality, ALL HUMAN RACE and the multi-colored signifying the different cadres of the Society
Bottom line is, everyone goes through these phases of life – White or Colored, Rich or poor, Young and Old.

The Perfect Circle represents a perfect life, everyone desires it, yet no one ever achieves it, 
making peace with that knowledge ushers the human race an opportunity at peace with self, which becomes 
another interpretation of the art, only to those who stops seeking the first representation (Perfection)

The Rough Edged, Packed Polygon represents the choked existence of many, choked with activities, work, 
an Ideology, Something, Anything at all. Sometimes we forget to live because of these 
seeming Obsessions as they could be likened.

The Circles with Periodic Bumps at some point represents the realism of man’s existence on earth, Good and Bad,
Wins and Losses, Failures and Victories. I like to think no one has it all, the bumps experienced in daily existence
somehow create a balance in life, makes one stronger and keeps one vigilant and cautious for incomings. 
It’s not pessimism, it’s maturity and growth, it is wisdom.

The Circles with Sharp cuts at some point Represents the extreme situation of many. The existence of some could be
likened to Violence and Roughness, sometimes the reality seen deceive them into believing the violence 
is all there is to their lives, but there’s always a point of Peace, Rest, Escape from it all,
even though they fail to see it sometimes. Ideally, People find rest in different places, could be; at home, in a
person or in solitude, all unique to the individual. But no matter the turbulence, there’s usually a point of peace, 
even if we have to peg that point to the point of birth and ignorance.

The Horizontal Waves with All Round Turbulence Takes after the afore, (The Circles with Sharp cuts at some point) Difference 
is there’s no peace and Calmness at any point. This is because it doesn’t acknowledge the existence of peace in life, 
it has so programmed the mind into believing life for it is Turbulence Defined, so it becomes reality. Eventually, 
loses it’s place of escape, because it’s existence was never acknowledged to start with.

The Horizontal Waves with a straight line at some point is likened to The Circles with Periodic Bumps, only it belongs to the school of thought
that there’s just life, and nothing after life.

The Horizontal Waves with a straight line all through is like the Perfection in the endless Cycle called Life. It represents
the perfect life with no challenges, no turbulence. It’s a happy existence until Death snatches it all away. Then it all stops 
like it was never there, and there’s no continuation.
